1. Topography data:

Download the topography data to GEF/PRP/data_in/static.  The topography files
can be found at http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/wrkstn_eta/topo.html.

2. Initial data:

cd GEF/PRP/bin
get_data.scr  00  (Here 00 represents cycle, it may also be 06, 12, 18) 

This data file is in grib format.  The data is GFS data from NCEP.

3. Surface data (sst and snow depth):

cd GEF/PRP/bin
get_sfcfields.com 

Also in grib format.  However the snow depth seems missing.  I did not find the 
new links for this.

4. edit configure to set parameters.
   (nm=6 for cube, nm=14 for octagon).

   run : configure

5. cd GEF/PRP/src

for cube:
   make cube

for octagon:
   make octa

6. cd GEF/PRP/bin

   for cube:  ../exe/initCube.exe       ( prepare cubic grid )
              ../exe/metrcs.exe         ( prepare the grid constants )

   for octagon:  ../exe/initOcta.exe    ( similar as cubic grid case )
                 ../exe/metrcs.exe

   for both:  qsub topo.scr  ( Prepare topology for the grid. I use job submission script topo.scr.  
                               You may look at this script for the running of the topo in your system. ) 
              pr_assim.sh  ( prepare initial data for the model )

7. cd GEF/RUN/src

   make cube (octa)

8. cd GEF/RUN/job

   qsub qs1 (qs2, qs1oc for different configurations).  (Run the model)

9. cd GEF/PRP/bin
   ../exe/etapost.exe  ( The output files are in GEF/PRP/data_out/globrun*.dat.  You may look at 
                         the file GEF/PRP/src/post/qu2ll2.f90 and/or GEF/PRP/src/post/qu2ll.f90 for
			 the output fields.  You may switch between qu2ll and qu2ll2 in etapost.f90)
